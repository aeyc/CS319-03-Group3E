**Project Topic**: A strategy desktop game inspired by "Walls&Warriors".

**Project Description** 

In this project we are aiming to develop a game which is inspired by the box game “Walls&Warriors” by Smart Games. 
The goal of the game is that the player should protect her/his castle with his/her knights by building walls. 
The components of the game is a virtual game board which the game will be placed, 
we will show this afterward the choosing pattern screen. 
4 or more different wall shapes which will be given to the player to 
build the walls to keep the castle and friendly knights inside the walls, 
1 castle tower as the base, 
3 or more side-knights (blue), 
4 or more enemy-knights (red). 
We are planning to add extra modes (classical-level design-campaign) to our application. 
Upgrades will be decided later.

In the classical mode of our application, 
there are various patterns that player can choose and based on the desired pattern, 
enemy warriors and player’s warriors are placed. 
Initially, the player should pick up the pattern which he/she want to challenge him/herself. 
Regarding that choice, the game will be set up; 
the castle tower and knights will be built on to the virtual game board within this pattern, 
the game will be ready to play. 
The player should analyze wisely then build walls to protect the castle and side-knights. 
Also, the enemy knights should be kept outside of the walls to pass the levels.
Moreover, we are planning to add another mode that the player can make the level design of pattern, 
number of knights own. 
In this mode, there will be an empty virtual game board 
that the player can decide how many knights and where they will be placed.

In campaign mode, we are planning to add stories to levels to make the game more impressive; 
we will show a story to our player at the beginning of the game; 
while the player is playing, 
there will be popups to give strategy to the player.
Moreover, there will be more roles in this mode, other than knights. 
We are planning to add characters such as mercenaries with different powers. 
In this way, if the player can reach these characters, 
these characters interact with each other and flow of events in the game will change. 
Also, we are planning to add time option that 
the user should finish the game in this decided time to win and pass the level.
